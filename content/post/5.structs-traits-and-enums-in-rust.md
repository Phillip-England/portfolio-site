## Sandbox
[Here](https://github.com/Phillip-England/sandbox-gpt-session-rust-0) is the repo where I coded around to get a bit familiar with these concepts.

## Overview
The concepts discussed in this article have to do with modeling data in Rust. We will explore Structs, Enums, and Traits, all of which give us ways to define data and group behaviour amongst types.

I used chatGPT to walk me through these topics.

## Structs
Structs are a way to group related data, not much different than any other language which uses structs. One thing I noticed while reading [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html) is that if you try to make their field of a struct a reference, then a lifetime will be required. This does not mean we cannot use shared data within a struct, but if we do use shared data within a struct, we will need to annotate the lifetime.

You have multiple types of structs:
- classic structs
- unit structs
- tuple structs

Each other these have their own use-case.

## Classic Structs
The name pretty much defines them. They are structs in the way you would normally think about in other languages. Like so:
```rs
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    age: u32,
    active: bool,
}
```

I include the `#[derive(Debug)]` derive macro, which is a construct I need to learn more about. However, I do know it allows us to print out our type like so:
```rs
fn using_classic_structs() {
    let user = User {
        username: String::from("alice"),
        email: String::from("alice@gmail.com"),
        age: 30,
        active: true,
    };
    println!("{:?}", user);
}
```

## Unit Structs
Unit struct are struct with a specified type, but no real underlying data. Here is an example of two unit structs which are used as options:
```rs
#[derive(Debug)]
struct ReadOnly;
#[derive(Debug)]
struct WriteOnly;

fn using_file_modes<T: Debug>(_mode: T) {
    println!("{:?}", _mode);
}
```

We can then make use of the options like:
```rs
using_file_modes(ReadOnly{});
using_file_modes(WriteOnly{});
```

Take note: the above function makes use of a trait bound `<T: Debug>` which ensures any type passed into the function as `_mode: T` has the `Debug` derive macro enabled on itself.

I also learned the unit struct can be used as a singleton. For example:

```rs
struct Logger;
impl Logger {
    fn log(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Log: {}", message);
    }
}
fn using_singletons() {
    let logger = Logger{};
    logger.log("I am using a singleton!");
}
```

## Tuple Structs
Tuple structs are when you have a set of unnamed data whose relationships are obvious, for example:
```rs
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Color(u8, u8, u8);
```

In this instance, we know the values are `r, b, g`, so there is no need to name them explicitly.

We make use of the tuple struct like so:
```rs
fn using_tuple_structs() {
    let color = Color(255, 0, 0);
    println!("{:?}", color);
}
```

## Traits
Traits are behaviours that you can associate with a type. For example, here, we have a trait called "Describe" which has it's own default implementation:
```rs
trait Describe {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        String::from("this is an object with no specific description")
    }
}
```

We can then implement this trait on different types:
```rs
struct Animal {
    name: String,
}

struct Vehicle {
    model: String,
}

struct Unknown;

impl Describe for Animal {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        format!("This is an animal named: {}", self.name)
    }
}

impl Describe for Vehicle {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        format!("This is a vehicle with the model: {}", self.model)
    }
}

impl Describe for Unknown {} // uses the default implementation
```

To make use of these traits in a function:
```rs
fn using_traits_to_describe() {
    let animal = Animal{
        name: String::from("Tiger John"),
    };
    println!("{}", animal.describe());
    let car = Vehicle{
        model: String::from("Honda"),
    };
    println!("{}", car.describe());
    let unknown = Unknown{};
    println!("{}", unknown.describe());
}
```

## Enums
Enums allow us to define a type which may be one of many different variants. For example, here is an enum named, `Message`:
```rs
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(u8, u8, u8),
}
```

When we use an enum, we match it against all of it's possible variants. Then depending on which variant we get, we perform some actions. For example, here is a function which take sin a `Message` and prints out a statement depending on which variant we get:
```rs
fn using_enum_with_match_arm(message: Message) {
    match message {
        Message::Quit => println!("quitting!"),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Write message: {}", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, b, g) => println!("Change color to RBG({}, {}, {})", r, b, g),
    }
}
```

Notice, each variant can have it's own unique set of data. The variants do not have to share data between each other. This is what makes enums unique. Also, the match statements must cover possible outcome.

When we want to call the above function, we can do so like:
```rs
using_enum_with_match_arm(Message::ChangeColor(222, 222, 201));
```
