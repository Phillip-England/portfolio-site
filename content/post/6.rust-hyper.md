## Sandbox
The sandbox for this article is in this [repo](https://github.com/phillip-england/sandbox-rust-hyper).

## Overview
My goal is to learn about how to use [hyper](https://hyper.rs/), but more importantly, I want to take a close look at how to set up middleware.

In this article, I will be working my way through hyper and trying to understand how to use it to build a web application.

## The Basics
Hyper offers some pretty good docs to get going. I ended up with something like this off the bat:

```rs
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(addr).await?;
    loop {
        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await?;
        let io = TokioIo::new(stream);
        tokio::task::spawn(async move {
            if let Err(err) = http1::Builder::new()
                .serve_connection(io, service_fn(hello))
                .await
            {
                eprintln!("Error serving connection: {:?}", err);
            }
        });
    }
}

async fn hello(_: Request<hyper::body::Incoming>) -> Result<Response<Full<Bytes>>, Infallible> {
    Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::from("Hello, World!"))))
}
```

In the above example, the function `hello` is basically acting as a "catch-all" for all incoming requests. So, from within `hello`, we can get the request, determine the path, and perform some action depending on the path.

This is exactly what we want.

## What About These Types
I think it is worth it to take some time to see how `hyper` implements the `Request` type.

I found its documentation [here](https://docs.rs/http/1.1.0/http/request/struct.Request.html).

We can do this to get the request method:
```rs
async fn hello(req: Request<hyper::body::Incoming>) -> Result<Response<Full<Bytes>>, Infallible> {

    let method = req.method();
    println!("{}", method);

    Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::from("Hello, World!"))))
}
```

and then I ended up here:
```rs
async fn hello(req: Request<hyper::body::Incoming>) -> Result<Response<Full<Bytes>>, Infallible> {

    let method = req.method();
    let uri = req.uri();

    let req_data = format!("URI: {}
METHOD: {}", uri, method);
    println!("{}", req_data);

    Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::from(req_data))))
}
```

OK, so we can set up basic routing pretty easily.

## Asking ChatGPT
I asked ChatGPT to help me understand these types a bit more. I said, "what are we saying when we put `<hyper::body::Incoming>` next to `Request`", here is the response:

### What is hyper::body::Incoming?
`hyper::body::Incoming` is the specific type used for the body of the request when it's received by the server.

It represents a streaming body of data that is incoming from a client. This body type supports asynchronous operations, allowing the server to handle large or streamed payloads efficiently.

By specifying Incoming as the type parameter, we're saying:

"The Request object contains a body that can be streamed or processed incrementally as it arrives."

## What Other Types Can The Request Be?
I dug a bit deeper and learned a bunch of interesting stuff about how the `Request` type can be used.

Here is a [link](https://chatgpt.com/share/67600631-71ac-8005-b4d8-a257c5116ed0) to the full conversation.

One tid-bit I'd like to place here is:
```bash
5. Custom Types

Description: Any custom type that implements the HttpBody trait or is converted from the Request body.

Use Case: For structured data like JSON or XML, you can use types like serde_json::Value or even your own deserialized structs.
```

I think this line of thinking is going to be common around Rust.

## Basic Routing
The docs walk you through how to set up routing using a match table and it looks pretty nice. I wanted to go a simple path and build up. Here is what I got working for catching 404s:

```rs
async fn hello(req: Request<hyper::body::Incoming>) -> Result<Response<Full<Bytes>>, Infallible> {

    
    if req.method() == "GET" && req.uri().path() == "/" {
        return Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::from("Hello, World!"))));
    }

    Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::from("404 not found"))))

}
```

But there is a problem: we are not properly setting our status codes or headers. To fix this, we will have to start creating and modeling `Responses`.

## Crafting Responses
I found myself wanting to be able to make changes to my responses prior to sending them. Hyper offers a page on how to make a routing table. I made a few changes to the example and ended up with this:

```rs
// function to catch all incoming requests
async fn catch_all(req: Request<hyper::body::Incoming>) -> Result<Response<BoxBody<Bytes, hyper::Error>>, hyper::Error> {
    match req.uri().path() {
        "/" => {
            match req.method() {
                &Method::GET => {
                    let mut res = Response::new(box_response("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"));
                    res.headers_mut().insert("Content-Type", HeaderValue::from_static("text/html"));
                    return Ok(res)
                },
                _ => {
                    let mut invalid_method = Response::new(box_response("invalid method"));
                    *invalid_method.status_mut() = StatusCode::METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED;
                    return Ok(invalid_method)
                }
            }

        },
        _ => {
            let mut not_found = Response::new(box_response("<h1>404 not found</h1>"));
            *not_found.status_mut() = StatusCode::NOT_FOUND;
            not_found.headers_mut().insert("Content-Type", HeaderValue::from_static("text/html"));
            return Ok(not_found)
        }
    }
}

// utility function to box up our response body
fn box_response<T: Into<Bytes>>(chunk: T) -> BoxBody<Bytes, hyper::Error> {
    Full::new(chunk.into())
        .map_err(|never| match never {})
        .boxed()
}
```

That's a lot of code, so let's breakdown some things I learned.

### Setting Response headers
Response headers are set using the `Response.headers_mut().insert()` method. When using this, to pass strings in as the header value, I had to use `HeaderValue::from_static()` and that allowed me to properly set the headers on my response types. Here is an example:

```rs
res.headers_mut().insert("Content-Type", HeaderValue::from_static("text/html"));
```

### Catch-All In Match Expressions
I found it useful to use a catch-all for the match expressions when checking which method a request had as it came into the server.

This type of pattern feels very Go-ish. I like checking the path first, and then dealing with the method. This approach gave me a clean way to do this.

This is what I mean:

```rs
"/" => {
    match req.method() {
        &Method::GET => {
            let mut res = Response::new(box_response("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"));
            res.headers_mut().insert("Content-Type", HeaderValue::from_static("text/html"));
            return Ok(res)
        },
        _ => {
            let mut invalid_method = Response::new(box_response("invalid method"));
            *invalid_method.status_mut() = StatusCode::METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED;
            return Ok(invalid_method)
        }
    }
},
```

### Setting Status Codes
Very similar to headers, status codes are set using a method, `Response.status_mut()` and we use it like:

```rs
let mut not_found = Response::new(box_response("<h1>404 not found</h1>"));
*not_found.status_mut() = StatusCode::NOT_FOUND;
```

## Conclusion
I think hyper is a great way to get going with building web applications in Rust, especially if you are interested in creating libraries or frameworks. It is non-invasive and extremely minimal. All it really does is provide a few core types to make handling requests and responses easier. That is really the whole deal.

I dug into middleware and I think I will do a whole post dedicated to setting up middleware in hyper. It looks like they recently did an overhaul and stopped using `tower` which is how they handled middleware previously.

All in all, I am going to learn this tool a bit deeper and come back with more content regarding middleware and route management.

I also think I need to learn a bit more about how to think in Rust. I came across this snippet of code and it made me realize I need to brush up on iterators in Rust:

```rs
let frame_stream = req.into_body().map_frame(|frame| {
    let frame = if let Ok(data) = frame.into_data() {
        // Convert every byte in every Data frame to uppercase
        data.iter()
            .map(|byte| byte.to_ascii_uppercase())
            .collect::<Bytes>()
    } else {
        Bytes::new()
    };

    Frame::data(frame)
});
```

NOTE TO SELF: Did you do an article about iterators in Rust?
