## Easy Peasy
It really is. Using [flint](https://github.com/phillip-england/flint), I run `flint spark`. The following is the resulting output, which walks you through each step flint takes as it bundles up your static assets.

```bash

## Why Flint?
You see, I found myself repeating a common pattern in my web applications. I consider myself fairly effecient with Go, and I can get a web server up and running with some html pages quickly.

I don't want to be locked into a certain way of doing things.

That's why I built flint, a minimal static site generator for people who can already get their static site running on a localhost server.

Why use some big static site generator when you might not have to?

## Follow Along
I can explain how `flint` works, but it's probably easier if you just follow along. Below, I will walk you through how to install this website, install flint, and use flint to generate a minified, static version of this website.


## Install This Website
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phillip-england/portfolio-site
```

You'll need `go` version `1.23.3` or later.

Once installed, `cd` into the project and serve it:
```bash
cd portfolio-site
go run main.go
```

Okay, now we can leave this application running in the background. 

## Installing Flint
In a new terminal, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phillip-england/flint
```

Then install:
```bash
cd flint
go install
```

You'll need to verify `go` properly installed the binary on your `PATH`. After, reload your terminal to ensure the changes take effect.

To verify installation, run `flint help`.

## flint.json
Inside of `portfolio-site` you should see a `flint.json`. Go ahead and take a look:

```json
{
    "host": "http://localhost:8080",
    "static": "./static",
    "favicon": "./favicon.ico",
    "out": "./out",
    "target": "https://phillip-england.com",
    "routes": [
        "/",
        "/posts",
       
        ... more routes
    ]
}
```

This config tells flint where to ping, which routes to ping, and where all the static assets are located. It also tells flint where the website will be deployed so all `href` values can be changed to absolute paths pointing towards the deployment location.

## Generating The Site
Navigate back to the `portfolio-site` and make sure it is still running in the background on `localhost:8080`.

Once you've ensured the website is still running locally, run the following command from within `portfolio-site`:
```bash
flint spark
```

Afterward, you should see a new directory named `./out` at `/portfolio-site/out`.

This directory contains all the static assets for the site and can easily be dropped into any static deployment environment.
