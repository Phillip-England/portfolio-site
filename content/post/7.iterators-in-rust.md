## Sandbox
The git repo where I played around with these ideas can be found [here](https://github.com/Phillip-England/sandbox-iterators-in-rust).

Also, my conversation with chatGPT regarding this topic can be found [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67615a1d-8ce4-8005-a8f1-018d879944c7).

## Pitstop
While I was learning [hyper](https://hyper.rs), I realized I needed to take a pitstop and learn a bit more about Rust iterators. From what I understand, iterators are preferred over loops and I see them used a lot around Rust.

I know with the zero-cost abstraction model Rust has, it makes using iterators the same cost as running a loop. Let's see whats up.

## The Book
First, I read the entry in [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) regarding iterators to see what the Rust team has to say about them.

### Lazy
First, I learned iterators are lazy and they do not do anything until you consume the iterators.

This means that iterators are first created, then consumed. Can an iterator be consumed more than once? Nope.

Here is an example of iterating through a vector:
```rs
fn using_iter_on_vec() {
    let some_vec = vec!["a", "b", "c"];
    let my_iterator = some_vec.iter();
    for val in my_iterator {
        println!("Value: {}", val);
    }
}
```

### Many Different Methods
Iterators are really Rust's take on higher order functions. It looks like many different methods can be combined to get different results with your iterator. I think the key here is really understanding what these methods do and how they work.

Here is an example of transforming data with `map` and gathering the output into a vector with `collect`:
```rs
fn using_map_and_collect() {
    let v = vec![0, 1, 2];
    let incremented: Vec<_> = v.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();
    println!("{:?}", incremented);
}
```

In this example, I see two concepts I am not entirely sure of so I need to diverge and research them.

### Vec<_>
I am guessing the `Vec<_>` represents some generic type. Maybe it means the lack of a type? I don't know. But I know I want to know!..

..OK it looks like the `Vec<_>` syntax is a way of stating the variable is a vector with a type that should be inferred based on how the vector is used. This is a concept that has come up a few times but I'd like to state it here:

Rust is always attempting to guess the types in your code base and it is able to do so because of how strict the compiler is. Here, when we use `Vec<_>`, we are knowingly taking advantage of the fact that the compiler can make inferences about the code base and about how types are used.

### Inspecting Closures
I am taking note of this line here:

```rs
let incremented: Vec<_> = v.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();
```

I notice a closure is used in `map()` and I need to do a little bit of research about how closures work in Rust.

I do want to address them a bit right here, though. Let me do a bit of digging to get some light context..

..OK, the first thing I am finding is that closures are intended for short-lived computations. They are similar to `lambda` functions in other languages. Basically, a closure is an unnamed function that lives only for the time it is used.

The basic syntax of a closure is:
```bash
|parameters| expression
```

Another unique thing about closures versus functions is that closures capture variables from their surrounding environment while functions do not.

Oh man, this might be a bigger trail than I thought..

## Closures
It seems I've made an error. Iterators are useful, but they make heavy use of closures. And if we do not understand closures, then we cannot make proper use of iterators.

We need to spend some time looking into closures and getting a good grasp on how they are used.

I mentioned it above, but the first thing to know is that closures capture their surrounding environment. For example:
```rs
let y = 5; 
let add_y = |x| x + y; // `y` is captured from the environment
println!("{}", add_y(3)); // 8
```

### How Closures Capture Their Environment
I am learning the majority of this from chatGPT, so be sure to checkout [the chat](https://chatgpt.com/share/67615a1d-8ce4-8005-a8f1-018d879944c7) as this content is being directly influenced from it's output.

It looks like a closure can capture the surrounding environment by:

borrowing:
```rs
fn using_closure_with_borrow() {
    let x = 10;
    let my_closure = || println!("x is {}", x);
    my_closure();
}
```

mutably borrowing:
```rs
fn using_closure_with_mut_borrow() {
    let mut x = 10;
    let mut increment_x = |y| x += y;
    increment_x(1);
    println!("x is {}", x);
}
```

And take note in the above example, we marked the closure itself as `mut` along with `x`, the value being mutated.

And finally, taking ownership:
```rs
fn using_closure_with_ownership() {
    let x = String::from("I am owned!");
    let take_x = move || println!("{}", x);
    take_x();
    // println!("{}", x); // Error: `x` has been moved
}
```

### Where Can Closures Be Used?
Anywhere a function or callback is expected. This is what makes closures so popular with iterators, the topic we are currently discussing, remember?

### Creating a Function Which Takes a Closure
And I am just too curious to walk away. Here is a function which takes a closure as input:

```rs
fn using_fn_with_closure_input<F>(func: F) where F: Fn(String) {
    func(String::from("I am injected into the closure!"));
}

using_fn_with_closure_input(|str| println!("{}", str));
```

Oh and this is very helpful. Here, I discovered the way in which we use `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`, will dictate the way our closure captures its environment when being utilized as input into a function.

```rs
fn call_fn<F: Fn()>(f: F) { f(); }           // Fn
fn call_fnmut<F: FnMut()>(mut f: F) { f(); } // FnMut
fn call_fnonce<F: FnOnce()>(f: F) { f(); }   // FnOnce

let x = String::from("Hello");

call_fnonce(move || println!("{}", x)); // Takes ownership (FnOnce)
call_fn(|| println!("This just borrows")); // Borrows (Fn)
```

Just know, if we are ever in a situation where we are using a closure as input to a function, choosing between the three above options is part of the process and influences how the closure handles memory in relation to it's environment.

## Back To Iterators
We can filter a list of elements using `filter`:
```rs
fn using_filter() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    let even: Vec<_> = nums.iter().filter(|&&x| x % 2 == 0).collect();
    println!("{:?}", even);
}
```

I can see why people love iterators with how concise the syntax is. However, in the above example, I am wondering why `&&x` was used.

For some reason, these two options run fine as well:
```rs
fn using_filter() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    let even: Vec<_> = nums.iter().filter(|x| *x % 2 == 0).collect();
    println!("{:?}", even);
}

fn using_filter() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    let even: Vec<_> = nums.iter().filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0).collect();
    println!("{:?}", even);
}
```

Now, it makes sense and I understand how dereferencing works in the first example, but I do not understand why both `&&x` and `&x` work in this scenario..

..OK it looks like all three have the same outcome. I still don't fully understand why, but I do know in the above example everything resolves to `i32`. Using `&&x` is somehow communicating a double-unwrapping of a reference, but also seeing `&x` is the "correct" way to go about it. All in all, I feel confortable with both `*x` and `&x` so I will just stick to `&x` until I learn more.

## Implementing Your Own iterators
I think the most important question is, "How do we make our own types iterators?". Well, `Iterator` is just a trait. We like with any trait, we can implement the trait on our custom types.

Here is a `TimeBomb` type I implemented the `Iterator` trait on and then made use of in the function `using_custom_iterator`:

```rs
struct TimeBomb {
    count: u32,
    limit: u32,
}

impl Iterator for TimeBomb {
    type Item = u32;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.count += 1;
        if self.count < self.limit {
            Some(self.count)
        } else {
            println!("ðŸ’¥");
            None
        }
    }
}

fn using_custom_iterator() {
    let mut tb = TimeBomb{
        count: 0,
        limit: 10,
    };
    while let Some(count) = tb.next() {
        println!("{}", count);
    }
}
```

## Other Examples
Here are some of the other examples I ended up coming across, all of which are in the repo listed above:

```rs
// combining methods like map and filter
fn using_map_and_filter() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4,5,6];
    let doubled_even: Vec<_> = nums
        .iter()
        .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0)
        .map(|&x| x * 2)
        .collect();
    println!("{:?}", doubled_even);
}

// consuming an iterator using sum
fn using_sum_to_consume() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4];
    let total: i32 = nums.iter().sum();
    println!("{:?}", total);
}

// chaining operations with fold and building accumlative values
fn using_fold_to_accumulate() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
    let sum = nums.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);
    println!("{:?}", sum);
}

// using into_iter to consume and take ownership of a collection
fn using_into_iter_to_take_ownership() {
    let nums = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
    for num in nums.into_iter() {
        println!("{}", num);
    }
    // nums is no longer valid
}

// using iter_mut to mutate values in place
fn using_iter_mut_for_mutation() {
    let mut nums = vec![1,2,3,4];
    for num in nums.iter_mut() {
        *num = *num + 1;
    }
    println!("{:?}", nums);
}

// using enumerate to add an index to each iter_mut
fn using_enumerate_to_index() {
    let colors = vec!["red", "green", "blue"];
    for (i, color) in colors.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{}: {}", i, color);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
I think iterators are an important concept in Rust and they seem very widespread throughout the language. Iterators are tied closely to closures, and so having a solid understanding on how closures interact with their environment is really the key to making solid use of iterators.
