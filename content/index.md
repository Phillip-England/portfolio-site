## Welcome,

My name is Phillip England, and I am passionate about programming. This website is my notebook. Here, I will be documenting my software development educational journey.

I began coding in 2019 when I became interested in making a website. I still remember when I ran my first for loop in the browser console. Since then, I've been programming as a hobby. Around 3 years ago, I ramped up my learning and have been waking up at 4AM to study.

A while back, I thought to myself, "I would probably keep coding even if it was never a career for me." That's when I knew I needed to start documenting my learning. There is a chance this is a craft I keep with me for a lifetime regardless of my professional endeavours.

That in and of itself might be worth something.
