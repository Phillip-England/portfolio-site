## 90% of People Reading This Suck At Programming
You're probably one of them.

I see code like this all the time in my own projects:
```js
console.log("da fuq")
```

So, if you want to avoid passing the reference of a null pointer to your mom, support me by reading about my current programming endeavours.

## Always Learning
I am a self-taught developer. My programming journey started around 5 years ago. It all began with wanting to get a simple website up, and down the rabbit hole I went. 5 years later, I've realized something: I am **dedicated** to learning.

Becuase of this, I thought, "What better way to learn than to *teach others*?"

And so this website was born. I am here to document my programming journey in the hopes of inspiring and educating others.

## Background
I have been focused primarly on web development. I love both backend and frontend, but I *really* enjoy tooling and thinking through new ways to do things. I also enjoy learning new tools and deriving inspiration from them.

I started coding in Javascript, but have touch on most of the modern languages in some capacity.
